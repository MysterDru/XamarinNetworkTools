[![Build status](https://dev.azure.com/drewfrisk/Github/_apis/build/status/XamarinNetworkTools-CI)](https://dev.azure.com/drewfrisk/Github/_build/latest?definitionId=8)
[![NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/XamarinNetworkTools)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/XamarinNetworkTools/)

This is a library for Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS to expose some utility methods for doing ping operations. This was built for the specific needs of the project
that I'm using it in, so it may not be directly usable for things that you're working on. I wanted this code to live outside from the main app project, so 
it's living inside of a nuget package.

The android code was ported from [https://github.com/stealthcopter/AndroidNetworkTools](https://github.com/stealthcopter/AndroidNetworkTools).

The iOS code is a binding library of [https://github.com/mavris/MMLanScan](https://github.com/mavris/MMLanScan).

### How to use

`// TODO: add docs on how to use the library methods`

See sample projects for the time being.
